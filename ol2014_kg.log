03:36:25  Performance Advisory: Logical log file size might be too small for a
          checkpoint to complete.
03:36:25   Results: The size of individual logical log files is too small for
          the current workload, resulting in each log file filling very
          quickly. If log files fill in less than 30 seconds, the checkpoint
          might remain blocked because the last log file fills during the time
          needed to perform the checkpoint.
03:36:25   Action: Increase the size of the individual logical log files so
          that it takes at least 30 seconds to fill each one. Look at the
          online log to determine how quickly the log files are filling, and
          then increase the size of the files proportionately.

06:47:20  Performance Advisory: Logical log file size might be too small for a
          checkpoint to complete.
06:47:20   Results: The size of individual logical log files is too small for
          the current workload, resulting in each log file filling very
          quickly. If log files fill in less than 30 seconds, the checkpoint
          might remain blocked because the last log file fills during the time
          needed to perform the checkpoint.
06:47:20   Action: Increase the size of the individual logical log files so
          that it takes at least 30 seconds to fill each one. Look at the
          online log to determine how quickly the log files are filling, and
          then increase the size of the files proportionately.
06:47:20  Performance Advisory: Long transactions are causing blocking checkpoints.
06:47:20   Results: Transactions are being blocked until the checkpoint is complete.
06:47:20   Action: Increase the logical log space size.

06:47:21  Logical Log 55 Complete, timestamp: 0xf4200.
06:47:24  Performance Advisory: Based on the current workload, the logical log space might be too small to
accommodate the time it takes to flush the buffer pool.
06:47:24   Results: The server might block transactions during checkpoints.
06:47:24   Action: If transactions are blocked during the checkpoint, increase the size of the
 logical log space to at least 57400 KB.
06:47:24  Performance Advisory: The logical log space is too small for automatic checkpoints.
06:47:24   Results: Automatic checkpoints are disabled.
06:47:24   Action: To enable automatic checkpoints, increase the logical log space to at least 57400
